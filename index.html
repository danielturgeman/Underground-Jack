    <!--Very cool technique being used here. Two canvases, one for foreground and one for
    background. The foreground canvas will contain game entities such as coins, character,
    anything that "mario" interacts with." Background doesnt change so we have a
    background canvas as well. -->

    <!--The width and height of canvas are not random, they are scaled to about 3 times
    the sprite image size, scaled up and dependent upon the sprites. Foreground
    canvas has a higher Z-index, this way it will be placed on top of background canvas! -->



    <canvas id="bg-canvas" width="768" height="600"></canvas>
    <canvas id="fg-canvas" width="768" height="600"></canvas>
